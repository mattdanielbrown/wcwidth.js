How to build and install wcwidth
================================

This package does not provide an automated way to build or install the library
except using [`npm`](http://npmjs.org/package/wcwidth.js) because `wcwidth` is
intended to runs on top of [`node.js`](http://nodejs.org). If you have
`node.js` in your system,

    npm install wcwidth.js

brings the latest version of `wcwidth` and installs it with its all depending
packages.
